In early 2025, following a new round of sweeping trade policy announcements, former President Donald Trump introduced **“reciprocal tariffs”** minimum 10% tariffs on nearly all imports, with significantly higher rates (up to 104%) for certain countries like China, Cambodia, Vietnam, and others.

The tariffs were promoted as a way to **eliminate the U.S. trade deficit** and **punish countries considered “worst offenders.”** However, many international leaders, economists, and media outlets — including the **BBC** — raised questions about how these tariffs were calculated and what their real-world impact might be.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This dashboard was inspired by the BBC article mentioned above. After reading it, I wanted to **visualize the data** behind the claims being made.

The purpose of this project is **not to support or oppose** U.S. trade policy. Instead, it provides:
- A **neutral, data-driven view** of bilateral tariff relationships.
- An **interactive platform** for exploring how U.S. tariffs compare to those imposed on the U.S.
- A tool to **support informed discussion** on global trade — without taking a political stance.

> 📌 **Disclaimer**: This is an independent data visualization project. It does **not express political opinions** or endorse specific policies.
